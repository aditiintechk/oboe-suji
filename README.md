# OboeSuji

Sūji o oboeru (数字を覚える) translates to "memorize numbers" in Japanese, and this app is designed to do just that! Oboe Suji offers an engaging way to learn and master Japanese numbers by turning the learning process into an interactive experience.

The app presents you with numbers on the screen, challenging you to recall their readings in romaji, kanji, and hiragana. The answers are hidden at first, but you can reveal them if you're unsure or want to check your answer. To add to the fun, the app features a scoring system that rewards correct guesses with points. Your score will keep increasing as long as you avoid pressing the reveal button.

This classic, gamified approach makes learning Japanese numbers both effective and enjoyable. Share the experience with your friends and take your Japanese number skills to the next level!
